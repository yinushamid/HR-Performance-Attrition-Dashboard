# HR-Performance-Attrition-Dashboard 

## Business Story: Why This Project Matters  

As organizations grow, HR leaders begin asking deeper questions:  

- *Which departments experience the highest attrition?*  
- *Are employees fairly compensated relative to performance?*  
- *How satisfied are workers across departments?*  
- *Do we see seasonal turnover trends?*  

This project answers these questions by analyzing employee satisfaction, performance, attrition, and salary trends.  
The result is an **interactive Excel dashboard** that provides HR teams with meaningful, data-driven insights to reduce turnover, improve satisfaction, and guide smarter workforce planning.
